# Safety_and_Non_Safety_Comment_Classification

The Safety_and_Non_Safety_Comment_Classification repository is dedicated to creating a robust and effective solution for automatically classifying text comments into categories of "Safe" or "Unsafe". This project employs the power of zero-shot text classification using the Hugging Face Transformers library, allowing users to predict the safety status of text comments without the need for extensive training on domain-specific data.

## Features:

Zero-Shot Text Classification: Our approach leverages pre-trained language models to perform zero-shot classification, enabling accurate safety predictions without the need for fine-tuning on specific datasets.

Manually Annotated Training Data: The repository provides a collection of manually annotated comments, meticulously labeled as "Safe" or "Unsafe", which serves as the foundational training data for the model.

Effortless Implementation: The project includes a straightforward implementation that guides users through the steps of setting up the zero-shot text classification pipeline, training the model using the provided labeled data, and testing the model's performance on both known and new comments.

Versatile Testing: The repository offers the ability to test the model on both the annotated training data and user-defined comments. This showcases the model's adaptability to different contexts and provides an understanding of its reliability.

Open Source: The Safety_and_Non_Safety_Comment_Classification repository is open source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community. Users can extend the dataset, experiment with different zero-shot classification approaches, or integrate the model into their own applications.

## Usage:

Clone the repository and install the required libraries using pip install transformers.
Explore the manually annotated training data and add more labeled comments for enhanced performance.
Follow the provided code examples to set up the zero-shot text classification pipeline.
Train the model using the training data and assess its accuracy on labeled data.
Test the model's performance on new comments to evaluate its real-world effectiveness.
Whether you're interested in understanding zero-shot classification, working on text safety prediction, or looking for a starting point to build your own safety-related application, the Safety_and_Non_Safety_Comment_Classification repository offers an intuitive and adaptable solution.
