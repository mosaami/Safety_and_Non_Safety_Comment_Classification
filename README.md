# Safety_and_Non_Safety_Comment_Classification

The Safety_and_Non_Safety_Comment_Classification repository is dedicated to creating a robust and effective solution for automatically classifying text comments into categories of "Safe" or "Unsafe". This project employs the power of zero-shot text classification using the Hugging Face Transformers library, allowing users to predict the safety status of text comments without the need for extensive training on domain-specific data.

## Features:

Zero-Shot Text Classification: Our approach leverages pre-trained language models to perform zero-shot classification, enabling accurate safety predictions without the need for fine-tuning on specific datasets.

Manually Annotated Training Data: The repository provides a collection of manually annotated comments, meticulously labeled as "Safe" or "Unsafe", which serves as the foundational training data for the model.

Effortless Implementation: The project includes a straightforward implementation that guides users through the steps of setting up the zero-shot text classification pipeline, training the model using the provided labeled data, and testing the model's performance on both known and new comments.

Versatile Testing: The repository offers the ability to test the model on both the annotated training data and user-defined comments. This showcases the model's adaptability to different contexts and provides an understanding of its reliability.

Open Source: The Safety_and_Non_Safety_Comment_Classification repository is open source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community. Users can extend the dataset, experiment with different zero-shot classification approaches, or integrate the model into their own applications.

## Usage:
